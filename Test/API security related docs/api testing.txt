Test cases

1.Look for abnormal HTTP headers
API does not use cookie for authentication so the authentication also is in header. 
2.Authentication
Make sure each n every api is authenticated.
3.IDOR
Object level authorization check should be considered in every function that access data source using user input.
4.SSRF (server side request forgery)
API does not allow a user to mutate the server-side resources.
5.XML Attacks
If the api is supposed to json then try changing the content tpyr from application json to xml and see if it responds to the xml request.
6.DOS
7.Injection attacks
