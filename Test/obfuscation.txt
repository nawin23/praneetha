1. Rename classes, methods,variables, fields, annotations, and packages.
2. Alters the way data is stored. (For example, the arrays could be broken 
down into many sub-arrays. These individual sub-arrays could then be 
referenced at different locations of the program)
3. Storage obfuscation
This changes the very manner in which data is stored in memory. (For 
example, developers can shuffle between local to global storage of 
variables, so that the real nature of variable behavior is obfuscated)
4. Reorder how data is ordered by not altering the behavior of the 
program/code snippet. 
5. -Encrypt all readable strings. 
   -Hide & replace the strings with a nonsensical representation of the string. 
6. Use arbitrary strings and unexpected statements within the code and 
add random case-switch statements (dead code).
7. Mask the identifiable information by changing their identifiers, 
line numbers, or stopping the access to debug information altogether.
