1. Shared key authorization 
2. How Key & SAS is working
3. SAS configuration (expiry)
4. How you share the SAS?
5. What if SAS compromises 
6. How to retain the compromised url
-------------------------------------------------------------
********New design challenges**********

1. How to regenerate the keys?
2. Is azure vault is independent of storage account?
3. What happens if key gets compromised
4. what is the time period of key (key shouldnt have indefinite tym period)

5.   







Azure Key Vault protects cryptographic keys, certificates 
(and the private keys associated with the certificates), 
and secrets (such as connection strings and passwords) in 
the cloud.

When you create a key vault in an Azure subscription, it's 
automatically associated with the Azure AD tenant of the 
subscription.



az keyvault storage add --vault-name $keyvault -n $storage --active-key-name key1 --auto-regenerate-key --regeneration-period P90D --resource-id $storageid
