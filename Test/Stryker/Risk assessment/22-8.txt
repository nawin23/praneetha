Asset Management:

1.Identify & list down the assets.
	-Identify assets (e.g., network, servers, applications, data centers, tools, etc.) within the organization.
2.Assign each asset a value.
	-Based on the asset assign a value.
3.Ordering/Ranking by importance.
	-Each asset assigned score for each critical factor (ex: impact of revenue, profitability, public image, etc.,) & each critical factor is assigned a weight.
4.Data classification & Management
	-Assign classification to all data and grant access to data based on classification.
	-classify the data by access levels (ex: public, confidential, internal, external, etc.,)




3.Map data flows among your various resources (Building data flow diagrams allows you to understand better where weak points and vulnerabilities exist in your network).
4.As part of assigning value to your assets, you should categorize your data by access levels.
5.Classify the assets. (critical, major, or minor)


1.Properties
2.Characteristics
3.Values
4.Effecting factors
5.Classification
6.Data flow


1.Asset type/property (information/physical)
2.Asset connectivity (none/local/network)
3.Asset protection (physical/software)
4.Asset service (none/local/OTA)
5.value (critical, major, or minor)
6.Classification (ex: public, confidential, internal, external, etc.,)
7.impact type (ex: impact of revenue, profitability, public image, etc.,)
8.Order/Rank
