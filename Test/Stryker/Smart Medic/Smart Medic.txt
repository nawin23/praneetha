--Data minimization: 
	Thor-- Only data which is required for the planning of a knee suregry is acquired. 
  		The User needs and other specs documents (like SRS) document the accroding requirements 
	Smart medic-- Output from the SM device should only be captured in the NS.
		      The User needs and other specs documents (like SRS) document the accroding requirements 
--Anonymization:
	Thor: anonymization of private data is happening on application GUI
  	Smart Medic: How we are doing?
