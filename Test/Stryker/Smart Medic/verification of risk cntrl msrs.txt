4. Use hardened interfaces (n/w) & secure tunnel communications channel 
 -Ensure your firewall is properly configured and that all rules are regularly audited; 
 -secure remote access points and users; 
 -block any unused or unneeded open network ports; 
 -disable and remove unnecessary protocols and services; 
 -implement access lists; 
 -encrypt network traffic.

Secure tunnel Communication channel
 -The communication between the devices being used should be encrypted. In this case, if an unauthorized person obtains a document, he/she will not be able to read it
 -Corporate networks can be segmented into multiple VLANs to separate different resources. An office building with multiple departments should can have separate VLANs 
  for each department. In fact, logical network designs can tie into physical aspects of the building as necessary.
 -The communication should be encrypted using TLS, SSL or IPSec.





Target 1: Is system capable of blocking the malware
Target 2: Scanning & detecting the vulnerabilities using tools
Target 3: Exploit the loopholes using kali tools

-what type of malware & its exploitation?
-Firewall strength & its config rules?
-Anti-virus with updated signatures & validation?
-How hardeded interfaces are verified?
-Is there any trusted device option?

Stage 1: Initial setup
Stage 2: Execution
Stage 3: Expected output

id:89 changed-> Availability-low

Web app:
-
-Risk associated with the web app is Not affecting the product directly
-Hence the risk is not higher

Azure portal:
-map to IT admin doc
-Configuration will be done by IT admin
-Verification is required

DMT
not existing in the product. so verification not required.

-Have to be closed before DR8

//Azure portal verification
The published configuration document shall be verified for ensuring all the measures properly implemented
//

Have to be closed before DR-8

Using web app the admin can able to view the functionality of different components existing in the SM platform. Admin app doesnt control any of the system components. Hence the risk associated to the SM platform with admin web app can be ignored.
