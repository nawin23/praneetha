1)  Obtain knowledge about system internals
2)  Attempt to find attack vectors 
3)  Possibilities for exploitation of publicly known Vulnerabilities.

1. Tablet can be accessed only with admin credentials (it has enclosure also)
2. Gaining access for tablet device can only be possible by knowing admin (Stryker) credentials.
3. Access can only be obtained by the combination of above said methods.
4. Data unavailability to the cloud if tablet stops working.

1. Admin application can be accessed by login credentials & MFA. Hence, strong password 
   policies & management are required
2. Data transfer between the admin application and the smart medic components can be analysed 
   to gain access if unprotected.
3. Any vulnerable network ports and connection points should be identified and hardened.
4. If the adversary got the access to admin application then the web app gets unavailable & the 
   database gets affected.

1. Tablet runs on Kiosk mode and it is difficult to access tablet resouces 
2. As it is enclosed, gaining access through tablet resources is complex
3. It should be allowed to connect (using wifi, BT) only with authenticated devices
4. Network interfaces should be secured, else it impacts the tablet functionality

1.All devices which need to be registered & gets communicated in iot hub needs to be identified
2.Proper provisioning needs to be established with secure data transfer during provisioning
3.End-to-end provisioning with iot hub needs to be carried out without getting failed
4.All failure cases during the provisioning need to be documented/addressed

1.In complete SM environment, only authenticated stryker devices need to be present
2.Secure communication between the stry devices needs to be established & documented
3.Handling of the unauthenticated 3rd party devices trying to communicate 
with stryker devices needs to be taken care

v17- Use secure tunnel communication channel
• Maintain access control list.
/• Use strong encrption algorithm/
"• Server-side encryption using Service-Managed keys
• Network access control
• Encryption for sensitive data in transit, such as when
  files are attached to an email message or moved to cloud storage, removable drives
•  Transfer over encrypted tunnel"
-If data is sensitive then proper encryption mechanism needs to be 
designed & implemented

v18-
"• Server-side encryption using Service-Managed keys
• Network access control
• Encryption for sensitive data in transit, such as when
  files are attached to an email message or moved to cloud storage, removable drives
•  Transfer over encrypted tunnel"


-Using weak algorithms such as DES, 3DES, RC2, RC4, etc... should be avoided
