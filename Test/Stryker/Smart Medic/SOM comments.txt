- SOM should not be written as per the device components.
- It should be written as per the controls mentioned in PSSA & PSRT .
- For ex: 16 System and Application Hardening - We need to put this 
  as per the security controls & explain how each component is handlling 
  the control (device, tablet, nurse station application)
- With above said process tracing can be easily achieved.
16.2 User Account Management (PAUT-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) 
(For: Device, tablet, Nurse station application)
-> Who are the users of the system 
-> What are the kind of access they are having
-> Configuration options for them
-> Knowledge about login/authentication
-> Incident response- Training, testing, handling, monitoring & reporting etc...
25. SECURITY PROGRAM INTEGRATION
25.2 Incident Response
27. Contingency Plan Testing, Maintenance and Training

SA-13 Trustworthiness- CIA triad & thier responsibilities
 	- What Confidentiality items HDO has to take care 
 	- What Integrity items HDO has to take care
 	- How to maintain Availability
